mp_game
=======

This is an attempt at writing a basic "multiplayer" game in C that runs
in the terminal. I guess I decided to write this to teach myself a
little more about how to use sockets.

The repository consists of two projects, mp_server, and mp_client,
which are the games client and server respectively (surprise surprise).
