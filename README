mp_game
=======

This is an attempt at writing a basic "multiplayer game" in C that runs
in the terminal. This is simply a personal project to teach myself a
little more about socket programming in general.

To keep things rather simple, the game runs entirely over TCP. Obviously
this is unideal in a proper multiplayer game, which should make use
of UDP. TCP seems to be too slow for a realtime game like this.

The idea was to keep this project fairly simple to just at least get
an idea of how to do something like this somewhat properly.

The repository consists of two main projects, mp_server, and mp_client,
which are the games client and server respectively (surprise surprise).
